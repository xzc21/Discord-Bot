# Discord-Bot for Hack The North

*the updated version is in the master branch for some odd reason*
## Inspiration
We all use Discord and we wanted to understand the technology behind a Discord bot and how we could improve the user experience of bots.
## What it does
Our Discord bot allows users to play a variety of text-based games inside of their own Discord server
## How we built it
We built our bot using the discord.py Python library. We started off by building our games and then we integrated them in Discord
## Challenges we ran into
It was difficult to collaborate in an online environment and we feel that we would have been better off working in person on the project.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we successfully created 4 different games to run on our bot despite not having any prior experience with discord.py library
## What we learned
We all learned how to use the discord.py library and the basics of creating a Discord bot.
## What's next for Discord Game Bot
Our bot is set up in a way that we can always add more games to be played. So, next up for it is to expand the selection of games available.
